# Healthy-pantry-meals

Given I need a recipe based off items in my pantry
When I input ingredients into a search field and click on the search button
Then I am given a recipe, nutritional information, and an image of what the meal should look like

Given I want to keep track of past recipe searches
When I complete a search 
Then the past 10 recipes are shown in a list

Given I want a recipe emailed to me
When I enter my email address and click send
Then the complete recipe is emailed to me
